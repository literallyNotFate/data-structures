/*

An iterator is an object (like a pointer) that points to an element inside the
container. We can use iterators to move through the contents of the container.
They can be visualized as something similar to a pointer pointing to some
location and we can access the content at that particular location using them.
Iterators play a critical role in connecting algorithm with containers along
with the manipulation of data stored inside the containers. The most obvious
form of an iterator is a pointer. A pointer can point to elements in an array
and can iterate through them using the increment operator (++). But, all
iterators do not have similar functionality as that of pointers.
