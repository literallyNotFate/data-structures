/*

A dynamic array, also known as a variable-length array, is a
data structure that has the following characteristics:

The size can change during program execution: Unlike
static arrays, where the size is fixed at compile time, dynamic arrays allow you
to add and add elements to a program. arrays allow you to add and remove
elements while the program is running. Elements are stored in contiguous memory
locations: This provides quick access to array elements. to the elements of the
array. Usually implemented using pointers: Pointers are used to keep track of
allocated memory and control the size of the array.

Pros:
  Flexibility
  Efficiency (memory only for what is needed)

Cons:
  Resizing
  Memory handling
