/*

A queue is a linear data structure based on the FIFO (First In,
First Out). The items in a queue are ordered
one after another, like people in line at a store.

Pros:
    Simplicity
    Efficiency (O(1) operations)
    Order of execution
    Universality

Cons:
    Access only to the first and last elements
    Inefficient for tasks requiring arbitrary access to elements
    Blocking (if there is a problem with the first element, operations on other
elements are impossible)
