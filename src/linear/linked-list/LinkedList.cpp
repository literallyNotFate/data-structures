/*

A linked list is a basic dynamic data structure consisting of nodes,
each containing a value and a link to the next node. The first element
of the list is Head, the last is Tail, it refers to NULL.

Linked lists are similar to arrays, but adding and removing items from the
the middle or the beginning of the list is easier here, because there is no need
to change the indexes of all subsequent elements.

Pros:
    Is ordered
    Flexible size
    Time complexity of inserting at the beginning (prepend) and at the end
(append) is O(1)

Cons:
    Takes up a lot of memory
    Enumeration, insertion in the middle and deletion of an arbitrary element
have O(n) time complexity. time complexity O(n)
