/*

Stack is an abstract data type, representing a list of elements organized
according to the LIFO principle (last in - first out).

Stack properties:
    Element access: Accessible only to the top of the stack.
    Insertion and deletion: Available only from the top of the stack.
    Sequence: Items are retrieved in the reverse order in which they were added.

Pros:
    Ease of implementation
    Speed (all operations in O(1))
    Universality

Minuses:
    Inconvenience (access only through top)
    Inefficiency in some situations
    Danger of overflow
